    <ol> 
    <li>CDs (Compact Discs): Think of these shiny discs as futuristic music capsules. Back in the 90s and 2000s, CDs were super popular. They were like the coolest thing around, and almost everyone had a bunch. These little silver wonders brought music to our lives with really clear sound. Plus, you could easily pick your favorite songs with a simple click. Nowadays, you can find these musical treasures at garage sales. People often sell their CD collections, giving you a chance to experience the music that was all the rage during those years in a different way.</li>

Whether you're groovin' to pop beats, rockin' with electric guitars, or vibing to classical elegance, music is your ticket to a world of endless fun and imagination!
