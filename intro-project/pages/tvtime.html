<ol>
    <li> Gathering Around the TV: Back in the day, families and friends used to gather around the TV set in the living room. It was a shared experience, and everyone watched the same shows at the same time.</li>
    
    <li> Buying DVDs or Blu-Rays: As technology advanced, we could buy DVDs/Blu-Rays of our favorite shows. This allowed us to watch whenever we wanted, pause, and rewind scenes. It was like having a personal TV library.</li>
