<p>RENAISSANCE by Beyonce is a musical adventure. It takes you on a roller coaster of emotions. 
There is a mixture of genres on the album but the most common is house music which is sampled throughout
the project. She has been touring the album for a couple months now and it will come to an end shortly. </p>

    <!--Add a paragraph about whatever your H2 tag was-->
    <p> the album has a theme of self love and feeling confident in who you are. Songs like
    "I'M THAT GIRL, ALIEN SUPERSTAR & COZY" do a good job of this. Their upbeat beats and empowering lyrics
make for a powerful duo </p>
